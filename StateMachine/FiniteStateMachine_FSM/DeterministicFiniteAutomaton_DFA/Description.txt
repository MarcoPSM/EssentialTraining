The state machine for the traffic light example is a Deterministic Finite State Machine (DFA). 
Characteristics:

Finite States: 
- It has a finite number of states (Green, Yellow, Red).
Deterministic Transitions: 
- Each state has a defined transition to the next state without ambiguity.
No Additional Memory: 
- Transitions depend only on the current state, without considering external inputs or events.
